		<p>Nice to informally meet you! My name is Logan Hasty and I'm a 25 year old web development student. Ever since I graduated from high school seven years ago, I have had quite the difficult time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I've always been interested in coding and it was only until recently that I decided to pursue a career in it. I had looked at many different coding "boot camps" online, but couldn't bring myself to pay the tuition for the suspicion that I might be falling victim to a scam. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>While I was searching Google about three weeks ago, I stumbled upon UNCC's Coding Bootcamp and was instantly intrigued. I knew the school had a great reputation and I knew I could trust the education I'd receive from the course. I have only completed the first week (out of 24), but I feel that it will render me marketable to tech companies upon completion. I am very excited to get through this program, as I am trying my best to give myself a great future and get out of the dead end job I'm currently working.</p>
